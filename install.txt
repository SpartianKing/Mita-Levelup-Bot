The above command is used to install the dependencies. It cannot be ran via the file, but rather copy and paste the code.

```npm install discord.js dotenv sqlite3
```

Once that is done, copy the Copy_Example.env file to '.env' and set Your

DISCORD_TOKEN=Discord Bot Token. This can be found via the discord developers bot creation page under the Bot section

Next you want to define your Admin Users. In disord right click your username and copy the id. Then paste it into the array below, if you don't have multiple usernames, 
just delete the extra ,""
ADMIN_USERS=["#Your discord username or usernames","you can define another user here or as many as you'd like"]

This part is to define the channels where commands can work, as well as where your level up messages are sent. Just copy the id of each channel, and paste it into the values below.

LEVEL_UP_CHANNEL_ID= //define the level up channel id via discord

TRIVIA_CHANNEL_ID= // define the channel id where the trivia command ?trivia can be executed. 


ONCE that is all done, you will want to then navigate to your terminal (if on windows) and if your on linux, its similar. just navigate to the same folder as the main.js.

Next you want to run the command

```node main.js```
to run the bot.


On linux, if you want to run this in a new window, do command


```
screen -dmS dreamcraftnetworklevelingbot node main.js

```

this will run the bot in a new window and can be accessed via

```
screen -r dreamcraftnetworklevelingbot

```
